# Dynalist Vscode Theme

Make Dynalist look like VSCode.

Theme is made by making changes to the dark theme in Dynalist.

This is how it looks like:

Update 04 Jan 20: Made some changes to the original theme so it looks more readable to me. Why? VSCode usually have different colors in text according to syntax, but I usually just have text in Dyanlist. Check for `style2.css` file
